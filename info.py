about_me = "Ah, where do I begin? I‚Äôm Belisarius Cawl, the greatest mind of the Mechanicum. While others sit and tinker in mediocrity, I forge the future of the Imperium with intellect and ingenuity so vast that lesser beings can scarcely comprehend it. My mastery of science, technology, and the sacred mysteries of the Omnissiah is unparalleled. For over ten thousand years‚Äîyes, millennia, not mere centuries‚ÄîI have shaped the destiny of mankind. While the rest of the Imperium stagnates in its own ignorance, bound by archaic dogma, I alone have dared to innovate."
